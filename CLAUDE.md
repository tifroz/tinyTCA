# What is tinyTCA?
This is a SWift implementation of The Composable Architecture (TCA) for Swift, focusing on the core aspects with the ultimate goal of providing a pure Swift TCA library to be used on any platform where Swift is supported.

## Skip Tools
This library is intended to be used as a dependency for for skip tools native modules, but not intended to interact with transpiled modules. In other words, language restrictions that apply to transpiled modules do not apply here.
